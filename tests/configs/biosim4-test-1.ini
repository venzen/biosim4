# biosim4-test-1.ini

# This is a test config file for biosim4. To apply the test, run the biosim4
# simulator with the name of this config file as its argument. When the
# simulation terminates, look at the last line in the log file at logs/epoch-log.txt
# and verify that the five numbers on that line conform to these requirements:
#
#      first number (generation number) = 100
#      second number (survivors) = minimum 266, maximum 284
#      third number (diversity) = minimum 0.314, maximum 0.551
#      fourth number (genome size) = 64
#      fifth number (kills) = 0
#
# Run time on a desktop computer: approx. 1 minute.
